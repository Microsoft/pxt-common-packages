# set Tile Map

Arrange image tiles as a pattern in the scene.

```sig
scene.setTileMap(null)
```

Your game scene contains a [tile map](/reference/tile-maps). A tile map is an arrangement (a pattern) of image tiles that fill up some of the scene. At first, the scene has an empty tile map and no tile pattern is displayed. To build up your scene, you need to make some tiles, add them to the scene, and then tell the scene where to place the tiles.

## Parameters

* **map**: an [image](/types/image) where the pixels map tile images to a location in the scene.
