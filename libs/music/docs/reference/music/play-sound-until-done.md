# play Sound Until Done

Play some notes of music you have placed in a string and wait the sound to finish playing.

```sig
music.playSoundUntilDone('')
```

Your program plays the sound and waits for the sound to finish.

The notes of your sound go into a [string](/reference/types/string). The [**composing**](/reference/music/composing-sounds)
sounds page tells you how to make a sound string.

Also, there are built-in sounds you can use. These are part of the **Sounds** type. You use built-in sounds
instead of your own sound string with [``||sounds||``](/reference/music/sounds) like this:

```blocks
music.playSoundUntilDone(music.sounds(Sounds.JumpUp))
```
